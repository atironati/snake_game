TODO:

 - Snake statistics, leaderboard
 - Improved AI, multi-snake tactics
 - Actions/notifications (like if a snake dies in the pit, a
   notification pops up saying they died)
 - In game score-keeping on a per snake basis
 - Configuration screen
 - Terrain generation
 - Scrolling maps
 - Pathfinding visualization
 - More effecient pathfinding
 - Powerups (speed increase, multi-food spawner, temporary immunity,
   shoot venom, map skins)
 - Sprites/tiling/better graphics
 - Framework for running 100s of times and comparing/averaging
   statistics
 - In depth snake-focused storyline, detailing the hard life the snakes
   face everyday in the cold wasteland of the grid
 - Character profiles on the snakes, backstories, motivations
 - Other games (tetris, snake-themed flappy bird, RPG, sidescrollers)
 - Boss fights
 - Sound effects
